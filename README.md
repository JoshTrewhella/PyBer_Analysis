# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Omar, our client, has asked us to analyze the ride data of his ride-sharing business. The data he provided gives us the count of each ride per city, each city, the city type, the date of the ride, the number of drivers, and the fares per ride in two CSV files.

Using this data, he has tasked us to find the mean, median and mode of the total number of rides per city type, the average fares per city type and the total number of drivers per city type. We will be visualizing our findings in box-and-whisker plots as well as pie charts. 

## Results
We can see in our scatter plot that the average fares are the highest in the rural city types and lowest in the urban city types.

Our box-and-whisker plot shows that rides are most commonly in the urban city types and least common in the rural city types.

The urban fares account for 62.7% of the total fares, which makes sense considering there are more urban rides and they cost more than the other city types.

In our pie charts we can see that 68.4% of the total rides occured in urban city types and 80.9% of the total drivers are in urban city types.

Our line graph shows that the average fare of each city type is farely consistent from Jan-Apr, however there is a sharp increase in suburban rides in April along with a slight decrease in rural and urban city types.

## Summary
If changes in fares that occured during April is due to a yearly event, we could incentivize urban and rural drivers to offer rides in suburban areas considering the fares for the two latter city types are reduced during this time. 

The total ride percentage of rural and suburban city types is higher than the total drivers percentage of these city types. This lack of supply of drivers in urban and suburban areas could be the reason for the fares being higher in these city types. We could offer incentives to drivers to work urban and suburban drivers to help balance out the supply of drivers and fares.

we can also see that the urban fares during March are very inconsistent, so we can offer drivers in the urban area incentives to relocate to the other city types or offer discount rides during low demand times in this month to even out the demand for the drivers.
